### Student Info

-   Name: Maffie Cohen
-   Section: 01

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: top-down
-   Player Health: health bar
-   End Condition: player runs out of health points
-   Scoring: by destroying enemies

### Game Description

[Project] is unique take on the shoot-em-up genre, featuring a peculiar style of movement. Use your mouse to sling and whip around, shooting enemies as they chasse you down. Charge up your special attack by tricking enemies into shooting each other and press [SPACE] to discharge a huge pulse of energy! Just be careful not to get hit too badly.

### Controls

-   Movement
    - Your spaceship spins and swings around your cursor position (think sticky hand physics)
-   Fire: Hold the left-click to repeatedly fire. Press space when the power bar is full to discharge a huge blast

## You Additions

I drew up all the sprites and animations. The movement mechanics I used were also particularly unique (I don't doubt that other games have done this before, but not very often I don't think).

## Sources

-   me all of it is me I made and own everything it's all mine >:33333

## Known Issues

- It's kinda boring lol. I'll probably work out waves and stuff but for a few weeks this is what I came up with.
- (also no music or sound u_u).
- feel free to check out the over-break update tho!! It's not the submission that will be graded but I'll go ahead and make a release for it if you're curious. It's more for me and my portfolio though.
- As for actual like "x doesn't work" issues, I wasn't able to find anything in testing.
- If your score exceeds 9999 it will wrap back to 0. I couldn't get past 500 so it's probably ok but I could've added functionality and I didn't sooo


### Requirements not completed

- Player is not prevented from going off-screen. That was a decision I made because I couldn't figure a way to do it without interfering with the feel of the game (hitting a wall or suddenly popping out on the other side would be a little frustrating given how movement works). I'm happy to lose the 5 points there.
- Enemies are allowed to shoot each other. I KNOW I KNOW IT SAID NOT TO!! But I thought it'd be kinda neat if they could. They don't shoot themselves,  just each other so technically "Enemies [do] not take damage from their own bullets when they fire them". (but I'll happily take my -5 points if necessary because I think it's cool and I'm not changing it lol)
